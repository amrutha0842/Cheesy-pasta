Boil your pasta in water until your fork goes through the pasta

Convert the pasta into a different pan and pour enough sauce in

Pour your cooked pasta into the pan with sauce and evenly cover the pasta

Sprinkle some turmeric, salt and mustard seeds (mustard seeds are optional)

Evenly distribut the cheese (mozarella would be most ideal) over the pasta

Put the pasta and extra sauce onto your plate and you're DONE!
